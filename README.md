# TouchIME

Use your touchpad as an input method! This is a Windows
clone of the Trackpad Handwriting feature on macOS.

Currently only Synaptics touchpads are supported; however,
support for other devices can also be added by implementing
the `TouchIME.Input.IRawTouchInput` interface.

This project is currently under development. Use at your own
risk. Binaries will be available upon v1.0 release.

Text recognition is powered by Microsoft's
[Tablet PC API](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms826516.aspx).
